          <b>Boutique means size.</b> Therefore, we pledge to cap our fleet of
          managed aircraft at 15 aircraft to ensure a continuous high standard
          of service for all clients, whether aircraft owners or charter
          clients.
        </p>
        <p className={"text-justify"}>
          <b>Boutique means human touch.</b> Therefore, our clients not only
          rely on a dedicated point of contact for the organization of their
          flights, but the management team is also personally involved all the
          way.
        </p>
        <p className={"text-justify"}>
          <b>Boutique means attention to detail.</b> Therefore besides the
          personalized service we strive to deliver, we also give the same
          attention to the cost of operating our ownerâ€™s aircraft, as if they
          were our own, committing to transparency in everything we deliver.
