A year ago, JetHouse was just an idea. The company wasn’t even incorporated yet. But behind the idea, there was already a team of passionate aviation experts, united by a clear vision to offer a unique and personalized approach to private aircraft management.

Today, I’m proud to share some of the key milestones we've reached since our launch in February with our Falcon 7X.

— JetHouse has just signed a contract to operate a Challenger 605, which we expect to add to our AOC by the end of the year. This operation further solidifies our team’s credibility and expertise, particularly in Bombardier aircraft operations.

— In just 6 months, our Falcon 7X has flown 200 hours, connecting destinations such as Alaska, the Caribbean, the UAE, Africa, and across Europe.

Throughout this journey, our team has remained fully committed to delivering the highest levels of safety and compliance in our operations.

These first six months have also proven that our authentic and personalized approach is precisely what aircraft owners are looking for. JetHouse is built like a Family Office, meticulously taking care of each owner’s unique missions. We adapt to their specific needs; they can trust us by maintaining full transparency and provide neutral, unbiased advice about their aircraft as an asset. We believe this level of care can only be achieved by maintaining a human-sized operation with a reasonable fleet size. This is our ongoing commitment.

Owners who value trust as the cornerstone of a successful aircraft operation will find a true partner in JetHouse.
